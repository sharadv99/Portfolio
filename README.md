My name is Sharad Varadarajan, and I am a graduate of the Masters in Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at University of California, Berkeley. I have considerable professional experience in the world of technology and management consulting, which has helped me hone both my hard and soft skills. One common theme across the projects/challenges I have tackled in my professional career is the importance of data-driven decision making, which fueled my interest in pursuing higher education in data science.
